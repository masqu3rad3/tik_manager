Tik Manager is a lightweight multi platform asset and project management system.

A project manager helps team members to maintain focus on the task at hand.
Regardless of the scale of the project. Without a project manager, artists tend to waste 
precious time while trying to stay organized or -much worse- they may lose data due to the lack of organization.

The goal is to create an everyday project manager which is easy to install and easier to use across different platforms.
Whole system requires little or no maintenance and all database is contained within the project folders. This means it is possible to copy or move the entire project
to another network drive or local disk and continue working.
Small to medium ranged teams are aimed as well as individuals.

Tik Manager already has been tested and used on dozens of tv commercials and several feature films.

Tik Manager has following features / tools:
* Consistent naming of scenes and versions
* Version and reference controlling
* Supports Maya, 3ds Max, Houdini, Nuke, Photoshop

Tik Manager follows a simple folder hierarchy. 
The folder structure makes sense for manual browsing. There are minimal nested folders. If at some
point, the user decides to stop using Scene Manager, it is possible to continue working without it.
However, Scenes saved after this point wont be included in the manager database

Tik Manager has the following hierarchy:
* Project Folder
    * Category
        * Sub-Project (If any)
            * Base Scene
                * Version 01
                * Version 02
                * ...
                
Scene Manager main window is not a browser window. It is NOT POSSIBLE TO OVERWRITE ANY PREVIOUS FILE.
With admin password, it is possible to delete entire base scene along with all versions. This should not be necessary in most cases.
